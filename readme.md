PHP + Nginx + MySQL + Docker

#### PHP
PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.

Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

#### NGINX
nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, originally written by Igor Sysoev. For a long time, it has been running on many heavily loaded Russian sites including Yandex, Mail.Ru, VK, and Rambler. According to Netcraft, nginx served or proxied 26.20% busiest sites in March 2019. Here are some of the success stories: Dropbox, Netflix, Wordpress.com, FastMail.FM.

#### DOCKER
Docker unlocks the potential of your organization by giving developers and IT the freedom to build, manage and secure business-critical applications without the fear of technology or infrastructure lock-in.

By combining its industry-leading container engine technology, an enterprise-grade container platform and world-class services, Docker enables you to bring traditional and cloud native applications built on Windows Server, Linux and mainframe into an automated and secure supply chain, advancing dev to ops collaboration and reducing time to value.

Because Docker increases productivity and reduces the time it takes to bring applications to market, you now have the resources needed to invest in key digitization projects that cut across the entire value chain, such as application modernization, cloud migration and server consolidation. With Docker, you have the solution that helps you manage the diverse applications, clouds and infrastructure you have today while providing your business a path forward to future applications.
